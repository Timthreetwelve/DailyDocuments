Day Codes
=========

D1 = Every day
D2 = Every two days, based on January 1st, 2019
DA = Every two days, based on January 2nd, 2019

SU = Sunday
MO = Monday
TU = Tuesday
WE = Wednesday
TH = Thursday
FR = Friday
SA = Saturday

WKD = Weekdays (Monday through Friday)
WKE = Weekends (Saturday and Sunday)

M + 1 or 2 digits = Day of the month. Leading zeros are okay, but not required. For example, M12 for the 12th day of the month.

ML = Last day of the month.

Y + 1 to 3 digits = Day of the year. Leading zeros are okay, but not required. For example, Y100 for the 100th day of the year.

EVEN = Any day of the month that is evenly divisible by 2.
ODD = Days that are not considered even.

And finally, any specific date expressed as mm/dd where mm is 1 or 2 digits representing the month and dd is 1 or 2 digits representing the day.
Leading zeros are okay, but not required. The separator can be either the "/" or the "-" character (without the quotes). For example, 11/25 for the 25th of November.

Some notes on day codes.

1. Day codes aren't required. If you just want items on the list but don't want them preselected, then don't use a day code.

2. It's not necessary to enter them in upper case but they will be converted to upper case before the list is saved.

3. There isn't any error checking for the day codes. If you specify M45 or BR549, that item simply won't be selected.

4. When specifying more than one day code for a single item, make sure to separate the codes with a comma.
