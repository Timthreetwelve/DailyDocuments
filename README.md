## DailyDocuments

DailyDocuments is an app to open documents, folders, applications or web sites based on the date. Do you need to open a spreadsheet every day to log your steps? Do you need to need to log your blood pressure every Tuesday? Do you open a Word document every other day? How about opening your personal finance software on the first day of the month? DailyDocuments can do this and more.
